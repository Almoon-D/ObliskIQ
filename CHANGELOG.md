## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-09

Session 1 — Foundation. No trading logic yet.

### Added

- The design documents: `docs/MASTER_PLAN.md`, `docs/SESSION_PROMPTS.md` and `AGENTS.md`
  (loaded through `CLAUDE.md`), plus `docs/DECISIONS.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md` and
  `docs/knowledge/README.md`.
- A read-only snapshot of the three legacy repositories under `legacy/` — ObliskIQ-lite-MCP
  @ `b1ebd49`, Inversor-Inteligente @ `68280e1` (the MASTER_PLAN §6.2 paths) and
  market-pulse-bot @ `900dbf4` — with `legacy/MANIFEST.md` listing every file's source,
  commit, licence, target and action. Legacy agent instructions are renamed so no tool
  loads them.
- The Python 3.14 scaffold: `pyproject.toml` (AGPL-3.0-or-later), `uv.lock`, the `obliskiq`
  package with one documented package per area of the plan, a `Makefile`
  (`setup`, `check`, `test`, `fmt`, `lint`, `types`, `imports`), ruff, `mypy --strict`,
  pytest with a coverage floor, pre-commit hooks and import contracts (the LLM layer cannot
  reach decision, execution or the broker; compute cannot reach the broker, httpx or
  execution; nothing imports `legacy/`).
- Foundation modules ported from ObliskIQ-lite-MCP with their tests: the error hierarchy,
  structured logging (JSON or text, UTC), tolerant numeric coercion, UTC time helpers and
  the HTTP retry loop.
- The environment loader: every credential and deployment location the plan names, with
  every key, token, account id and personal identifier held as a secret that never reaches
  a repr, a log line or an error message.
- The configuration system: expert defaults in `config/defaults/`, the owner's panel in
  `config/owner.yaml`, merged into one validated model that remembers where every value
  came from and fails with plain-language, file-and-key messages; the `es` jurisdiction
  profile and the policy registry that resolves a profile's policies; an append-only,
  hash-chained, lock-protected settings-change audit log.
- The command line: `obliskiq config validate` and `obliskiq settings show`, with
  `--config-dir` and `--env-file`.
- Guard tests: every config key has a consumer, no committed secrets or personal data, no
  magic numbers in decision paths, packaging, the environment template, the CHANGELOG
  section for the current version, the workflows and the legacy snapshot.
- CI (`ci`: `make check` on uv-managed Python 3.14), automatic releases from this file,
  weekly grouped Dependabot updates and the pull-request template.
